# Applying Forensic Accounting Techniques using SQL and R
This is demo code for my Applying Forensic Accounting Techniques using SQL and R presentation.  In this repository, you will get a copy of each of the notebooks I use in the talk.  You can get more details about the talk, including slides and links to additional resources, at http://www.catallaxyservices.com/presentations/outlierdetection/.

## Setup
To run this, you will need the following:
1. SQL Server 2012 or later.  I built this talk against SQL Server 2017, but the syntax should work going back to 2012.
2. Jupyter Notebooks with the R kernel.  I have a blog post on setting this up at https://36chambers.wordpress.com/2016/05/24/til-installing-jupyter-on-windows/.

## Data Loading
Run each of the scripts in order in the `Data\Bus Demo` folder.  The data you generate will not be exactly the same as the data I generate for the `dbo.Bus` and `dbo.LineItem` tables.
